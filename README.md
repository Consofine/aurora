## Northern Lights Notifier
I wrote this so I'd get notifications when the northern lights are active. I initially used Twilio, but recently switched to SMTP so I don't have to pay (or deal with Twilio). You can run this repo locallyâ€” I do so on a single board computer in my apartment so I don't have to pay for server costs but have it always available. See [this post](https://michaelconsidine.com/blog/building-a-northern-lights-notifier-in-python) for more background/info on the code.

### Setup
There are a few prerequisites before running this:
1. Install [tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)
2. Install all Python libraries in requirements.txt
3. Set up env vars:
  - If using Twilio:
    - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
    - `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
    - `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER`
    - `TWILIO_TO_NUMBER`
  - If using SMTP:
    - `TO_EMAIL`
    - `FROM_EMAIL` (I think this has to be a Gmail account :/ that's why I added an encryption option through [envelope](https://pypi.org/project/envelope/))
    - `FROM_EMAIL_PASSWORD`
    - (optional) `GPG_PUB_KEY_PATH`: path to local file for GPG key encryption

### Running
Can just run this with `python main.py` (or `python3` or whatever). Other tips:
- To run in the background: `python main.py &`
- Or open a tmux session, run it there, and close without killing the session
